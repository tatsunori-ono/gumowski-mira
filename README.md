# Gumowski–Mira Attractor

Interactive visualisation of the Gumowski–Mira map built with Three.js.

![demo](demo.gif)

Two rendering modes:

- **Grid** — a uniform grid of dots deformed by the map, showing how the attractor warps space
- **Ink / Marbling** — feedback accumulation with blur and edge detection, producing fluid ink-like patterns

Controls: drag to pan, scroll to zoom, sliders for μ, iteration speed, point size, decay, blur, and edge strength.
